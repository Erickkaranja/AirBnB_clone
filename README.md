This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration… 

The command interpreter
The command interpreter will help us manage our project objects i.e:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Update attributes of an object
    Destroy an object
